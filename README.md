Mermaid video game

## Installation

    npm install
    
Installs node modules and does a webpack build as a post install script, which updates the bundle in the dist folder.

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the game. 

## Development

    npm start
    
Starts a webpack dev server that allows live reloading as you work on the code.

Open `http://localhost:8080/index-dev.html` in your browser to see the game (difference between `index-dev` and `index` 
is that in the dev version, the JS bundle served from the dev server is used and live reloading is enabled).
