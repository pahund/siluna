Mermaid video game

## Installation

    npm install
    
Installs node modules and does a webpack build as a post install script, which updates the bundle in the dist folder.

Open `boxes.html` in your browser to see the boxes demo where I'm experimenting with the Spine plugin for Pixi.js.

## Development

    npm start
    
Starts a webpack dev server that allows live reloading as you work on the code.

Open `http://localhost:8080/boxes-dev.html` in your browser to see the boxes demo where I'm experimenting with the Spine 
plugin for Pixi.js (difference between `boxes-dev` and `boxes` is that in the dev version, the JS bundle served from the 
dev server is used and live reloading is enabled).
